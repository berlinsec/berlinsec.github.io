    "abstract": "In a TLS handshake, the client announces it's maximum supported version and the server then has to pick the version given this and its own level of support. TLS Version Intolerance refers to a widespread bug that many server implementations abort the connection when the client version is higher than the highest version number they support. This, in turn leads to clients downgrading voluntarily when experiencing connection failures.",
