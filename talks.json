    "abstract": "A short introduction into post-quantum crypto, talking about challenges and ongoing work. With quantum copmuters on the horizon we have to implement new cryptography primitives that are resistant against quantum algorithms. I'll talk about quantum attacks and what algorithms we can use to secure communication in a world with quantum computers."

    "author": "Frederik Braun",
    "abstract": "Numerous incidents have shown that Certificate Authorities (CA) are not always as trustworthy as they should be. This talk introduces various techniques that allow stricter setups in a safe way. First of all, HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) allows websites to enforce certificate pinning in the browser. Certificate Transparency helps establishing a verifiable append-only record of certificates. Lastly, DNS CAA records help establishing CA-pinning mechanism for both client programs as well as CA infrastructure."

    "author": "Tim Taubert",
    "abstract": "A short follow-up to Hanno's talk at the last meetup, covering the latest from the TLS 1.3 WG. I will talk about a new version negotiation mechanism that addresses existing version intolerance, and about GREASE, a mechanism aiming to prevent similar implementation problems in the future."
