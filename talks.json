    "abstract": "Whenever a new TLS version gets introduced existing implementations need to be able to properly handle that. A relatively simple version negotiation mechanism is therefore part of the TLS Handshake.  Despite being simple multiple implementations <a href='https://www.feistyduck.com/bulletproof-tls-newsletter/issue18_version_intolerance_tls_google_uses_post_quantum_cryptography.html'>failed to properly implement that Handshake</a> in the past, subsequently causing security vulnerabilities in the ecosystem. It seems the industry is on track repeating all the same mistakes again with TLS 1.3. The speaker has identified three vulnerable vendors (Cisco, Citrix, IBM), none of them has yet reacted in a proper way.",
