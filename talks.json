Title: Attacking and Defending Cloud Networks
Abstract: In this talk I will describe practical threats and solutions related
to malicious (hardware and software) switches in cloud networks.  In particular,
I will focus on cloud networks that i) consolidate control over the (hardware
and software) switches to a logically centralized controller and ii) use
virtualization techniques for multi-tenancy. I will present some of my most
compelling research from the past 4.5 years which involves work on covert
channels in the control plane, and isolation in the data plane. I will talk
about the attacks and defenses from a conceptual perspective and then support
that using real-world software and/or hardware. If there is time I can also
share some demos.

I'd like to talk for 30 minutes and then take as many questions as possible.
