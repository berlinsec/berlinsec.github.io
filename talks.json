    "abstract": " This talk will have a stern, very stern look at AngularJS in particular and shed light on the security aspects of this ever-popular tool. Did the super-hero framework do everything right and follow its own super-heroic principles? Does AngularJS increase or rather decrease the attack surface of a web application?
