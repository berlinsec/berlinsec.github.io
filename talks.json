    "abstract": "Numerous incidents have shown that Certificate Authorities (CA) are not always as trustworthy as they should be. This talk introduces various techniques that allow stricter setups in a safe way. First of all, HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) allows websites to enforce certificate pinning in the browser.
