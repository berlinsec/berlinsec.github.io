       <h3 class="presentation-title">Attacking and Defending Cloud Networks</h3>
       <p class="presentation-author">Kashyap Thimmaraju</p>
       <p class="presentation-abstract">Abstract: In this talk I will describe practical threats and solutions related
to malicious (hardware and software) switches in cloud networks.  In particular,
I will focus on cloud networks that i) consolidate control over the (hardware
and software) switches to a logically centralized controller and ii) use
virtualization techniques for multi-tenancy. I will present some of my most
compelling research from the past 4.5 years which involves work on covert
channels in the control plane, and isolation in the data plane. I will talk
about the attacks and defenses from a conceptual perspective and then support
that using real-world software and/or hardware. If there is time I can also
share some demos.</p>

        <p>
          We're a bunch of security enthusiasts.
          Mozilla is nice enough to give us the
          space, but this meetup and its leaders do not speak
          on behalf of Mozilla.
