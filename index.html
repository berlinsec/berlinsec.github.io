       <h3 class="presentation-title">IKEv2 in a nutshell</h3>
       <p class="presentation-author">Stefan-Lukas Gazdag</p>
       <p class="presentation-abstract">IKEv2 is the almost 15-year old key agreement protocol for IPsec, a popular protocol suite mainly used for providing Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) over IP networks. While IPsec only describes securing the connection itself, the key agreement is kept as a modular extra step. In this presentation we provide a basic overview and insight into the inner workings of IKEv2 and explain some of the rationals behind design decisions.</p>

       <h3 class="presentation-title">Going quantum-resistant: preparing IKEv2 for the quantum era</h3>
       <p class="presentation-author">Tobias Heider</p>
       <p class="presentation-abstract">Currently the IT industry is preparing for the emerging threat of scalable quantum computers which could break or weaken commonly used cryptographic schemes, thus compromising secure infrastructure and applications. Discussions on how to secure the Internet Key Exchange v2 in the future are ongoing and not yet converging to a single agreed on solution. The reason are different limitations or requirements by the protocol, implementations, the manufacturers or the users, respectively (just like with many other protocols). In this talk we examine promising approaches and explain the reasons for the trouble we currently have with adapting protocols.</p>

          We're a bunch of security enthusiasts.
          Mozilla is nice enough to give us the
          space, but this meetup and its leaders do not speak
          on behalf of Mozilla.
