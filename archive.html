       <h3 class="presentation-title">Quantum Cryptography - From the basics of Quantum Mechanics to Secure Key Distribution</h3>
       <p class="presentation-author">Christoph Hamsen</p>
       <p class="presentation-abstract">Quantum mechanics describes nature at the level of single particles. Its effects often defy our intuition and lead to "ridiculous" consequences. Recent advances have sparked novel technologies with implications for modern cryptography. In my talk, I will focus on the first quantum-cryptograpic protocol "BB84" which allows two parties to negotiate a provably secure private key by exchanging single photons known as quantum key distribution. I will introduce the physical basics, explain the working principle in detail and end with exciting developments and today's application via satelites.</p>

       <h3 class="presentation-title">deSEC</h3>
       <p class="presentation-author">Nils Wisiol</p>
       <p class="presentation-abstract">deSEC is an open-source and privacy-friendly DNS hosting service based in Berlin, Germany. Originally funded by a start-up scholarship, deSEC now became a Verein and aims to provide permanently free DNS hosting funded by donations and collaborations, offering features rarely seen in other providers, such as a restful API, fully automatic DNSSEC, IPv6-enabled API and nameservers, and immediate update of published DNS information. In this talk we present the technical organization, security and privacy of deSEC. Furthermore, we discuss how deSEC can promote DNS features like TLSA records that today are available, but are also rarely used.</p>

       <p class="presentation-author">Raphael Robert</p>
       <p class="presentation-abstract">Messaging Layer Security (MLS) is an IETF working group building a modern, efficient, secure group messaging protocol. The protocol includes advanced security properties, such as Forward Secrecy and Post-compromise Security in addition to message confidentiality and authenticity. This talk will cover how MLS works on a high level and give some context about secure messaging.</p>

       <h3 class="presentation-title">hacspec</h3>
       <p class="presentation-author">Franziskus Kiefer</p>
       <p class="presentation-abstract">hacspec is a proposal for a new specification language for crypto primitives that is succinct, that is easy to read and implement, and that lends itself to formal verification. hacspec aims to formalize the pseudocode used in crypto standards by proposing a formal syntax that can be checked for simple errors. hacspec specifications can then be tested against test vectors specified in a common syntax. The talk will give an overview of hacspec and formal verification for cryptographic primitves.</p>

       <h3 class="presentation-title">XSS through MIME sniffing</h3>
       <p class="presentation-author">Hanno Böck</p>
       <p class="presentation-abstract">Securing file uploads is not easy. MIME sniffing behavior both by web servers and by browsers can easily lead to XSS in many common situations in web applications. (An earlier version of this talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBJt3eR8-bg">is available on Youtube</a>.)</p>

       <h3 class="presentation-title">Code Execution Analysis in Mobile Apps</h3>
       <p class="presentation-author">Abdullah Joseph</p>
       <p class="presentation-abstract">Proper binary analysis necessitates the use of debuggers to monitor/alter the flow of execution. Mobile apps are no different. This talk will go over the techniques and methodology used to monitor, debug, and finally execute arbitrary code inside a packaged mobile app for analysis and debugging purposes.</p>

       <h3 class="presentation-title">Remote Code Execution in Firefox beyond memory corruptions</h3>
       <p class="presentation-author">Frederik Braun (@freddyb)</p>
       <p class="presentation-abstract">Browsers are complicated enough to provide attack surface beyond memory safety issues. This talk will look into injection flaws in the user interface of Mozilla Firefox, which is implemented in JS, HTML and an XML-dialect called XUL. Having achieved an XSS in the user interface, attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the browser application process, with cross-platform exploits of high reliability. This talk discusses fixed browser vulnerabilities from 2017 and early 2018.</p>

          We're a bunch of security enthusiasts.
          Mozilla is nice enough to give us the
          space, but this meetup and its leaders do not speak
          on behalf of Mozilla.
